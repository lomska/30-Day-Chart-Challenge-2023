## About
This repository contains the code for the graphs I created for [30DayChartChallenge](https://github.com/30DayChartChallenge). The graphs were built in <b>Plotly</b>, and the dashboards, the app, and most of the navigation were created using <b>Dash</b>, <b>Bootstrap</b>, <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. The given codes include only the part with graphs and allow you to reproduce similar visualizations, for example, in Jupyter.
